## My process

I started my project by structuring the HTML. So I created a file to write my CSS and then I added the font I would use and saved the projectâ€™s color palette in variables. Finally, I created my JS file and implemented a function that toggle the menu.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
